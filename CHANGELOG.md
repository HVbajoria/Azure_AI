# Azure OpenAI Realtime Audio SDK: Changelog

## 2024-10-01

Welcome to `/realtime` with Azure OpenAI! This is the initial release of library, sample, and implementation-focused documentation support to get started with applications and experiences built atop bidirectional, multimodal interaction using `gpt-4o-realtime-preview`. Included in the initial repository state are standalone Python and JavaScript clients together with samples. If just getting started, we recommend the javascript web sample as a starting point -- `npm install`, `npm run dev`, and you can interactively use `/realtime`.
